The most important law when dealing with alchemy is known as equivalent exchange. 
Alchemy is the ability to create and change elements to take on new shapes. 
However, you can not create something from nothing. 
Everything has an equivalent exchange and if there is an insufficient base for what you're trying to create there will be a drawback. 
This law determines how strong the transmutation will be.
